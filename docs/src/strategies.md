# Search strategies

The strategies form the parameter space of the sorted-search API. Each one
subtypes [`SearchStrategy`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.SearchStrategy) and is
selected as the first positional argument of `searchsortedfirst` /
`searchsortedlast`.

```@docs
FindFirstFunctions.SearchStrategy
```

## When to pick which

For most callers the answer is: pass [`Auto`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.Auto)
(the default in the batched API) and let it choose. The table below is for
callers who already know their access pattern and want to pin a strategy.

| Strategy | Best when | Cost when hint hits | Cost worst case | Uses hint? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`LinearScan`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.LinearScan) | answer is within a handful of slots of the hint | O(1) | O(n) | yes |
| [`SIMDLinearScan`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.SIMDLinearScan) | `DenseVector{Int64}` or `DenseVector{Float64}`, forward walk past the hint | O(1) | O(n/8) | yes |
| [`BracketGallop`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.BracketGallop) | answer may be either side of the hint, distance unknown | O(1) | ~2 log₂ n | yes |
| [`ExpFromLeft`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.ExpFromLeft) | sorted batch — hint is `prev_result`, answer is monotonically ≥ hint | O(1) | O(log n) | yes (as lower bound) |
| [`InterpolationSearch`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.InterpolationSearch) | `v` is uniformly spaced and numeric | O(1) | O(log n) | no |
| [`BitInterpolationSearch`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.BitInterpolationSearch) | `DenseVector{Float64}` and log-spaced (geometric) — opt-in, `Auto` does not pick | O(1) | O(log n) | no |
| [`BinaryBracket`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.BinaryBracket) | no hint available, or fallback | O(log n) | O(log n) | no |
| [`UniformStep`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.UniformStep) | `v isa AbstractRange` (or known-uniformly-spaced) | O(1) | O(1) | no |
| [`GuesserHint`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.GuesserHint) | repeated correlated lookups against the same `v` | O(1) | ~2 log₂ n | self-provided |
| [`Auto`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.Auto) | unknown access pattern | varies | varies | yes if supplied |

All hint-consuming strategies fall back to `BinaryBracket` when no hint is
supplied or when the hint is out of range. `InterpolationSearch` additionally
falls back to `BinaryBracket` for non-numeric element types.

## Equality search through the strategy framework

Strategies answer positional questions ("where would `x` insert?"). Equality
asks a different question ("is `x` at exactly which index?"). The
[`findequal`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.findequal) wrapper builds the latter
on top of the former: every strategy gets an equality variant for free.

```@docs
FindFirstFunctions.findequal
```

The sentinel for "not found" is `firstindex(v) - 1` (`= 0` for 1-based
vectors). Type-stable `Int` return, no `Union` with `Nothing`. Callers can
test for absence with `i < firstindex(v)`.

`findequal` routes most strategies through `searchsortedfirst + post-check`
generically, so `findequal(BracketGallop(), v, x, hint)`,
`findequal(SIMDLinearScan(), v, x, hint)`,
`findequal(GuesserHint(g), v, x)`, etc. all just work.

The [`BisectThenSIMD`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.BisectThenSIMD) strategy
short-circuits the post-check path on `DenseVector{Int64}` by dispatching
into [`findfirstsortedequal`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.findfirstsortedequal)
directly — same custom LLVM IR scan, exposed through the strategy framework.

`GuesserHint` is documented on the [Guessers](@ref) page.

## Notes on individual strategies

### LinearScan

Walks `±1` from the hint until the answer is bracketed. Cheapest possible
search when the hint is right next to the answer — two comparisons. The only
strategy whose worst case is O(n), so it should only be picked when the
caller has strong evidence that the hint is close.

For `length(v) ≤ 16`, `LinearScan` is faster than `BracketGallop` even from a
bad hint because the bracket bookkeeping costs more than a worst-case walk
across a vector that short. `Auto`'s per-query path picks `LinearScan` below
that threshold.

### SIMDLinearScan

Same algorithm as `LinearScan`, with the **forward** walk past the hint
lowered to 8-wide SIMD chunks via custom LLVM IR. The backward walk (when
the hint is past the answer) uses the scalar `LinearScan` path — the SIMD
primitive is only defined in the forward direction.

Specialized for `DenseVector{Int64}` and `DenseVector{Float64}`. Any other
element type falls back to the scalar `LinearScan` walk (this includes
`Int32`, `UInt64`, `Float32`, `Date`, `String`, and user-defined numeric
types). The dispatch is *static* — there's no runtime type test on a hot
path — so the fallback costs nothing per-call when picked at compile time.

Caveats:

  - **Element types**: `Int64` and `Float64` only. Anything else uses
    scalar `LinearScan`. This is a hard restriction of the LLVM IR: the
    vector load uses `<8 x i64>` / `<8 x double>` with 8-byte stride, and
    the broadcast and compare are typed accordingly.
  - **NaN**: a `NaN` element in a `Float64` vector compares as `false`
    under both `fcmp ogt` and `fcmp oge`, so a NaN in `v` is silently
    skipped by the SIMD scan. Sorted `Float64` vectors containing `NaN`
    aren't well-defined under any total order anyway — same caveat
    applies to plain `Base.searchsortedlast` on such vectors.
  - **Forward order only**: non-`Forward` orderings fall back to scalar
    `LinearScan`. The IR is hard-coded to the `Forward` comparison
    polarity.
  - **No hint**: falls back to [`BinaryBracket`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.BinaryBracket).
    Without a hint there's no direction information for the forward scan.
  - **Auto does not pick this strategy.** `SIMDLinearScan` is opt-in. It
    isn't part of the `Auto` decision tree because the regime where it
    strictly beats `LinearScan` (long forward walks on `Int64`/`Float64`)
    overlaps with the regime where `Auto` already prefers
    [`BracketGallop`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.BracketGallop) or
    [`ExpFromLeft`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.ExpFromLeft). Pin it
    explicitly when you have a workload that wants a long linear forward
    scan and you know the element type.

### BitInterpolationSearch

`InterpolationSearch` with the extrapolation guess computed on the IEEE
bit pattern of `v` rather than the float values themselves. For positive
Float64 values, the IEEE bit pattern is monotonically increasing with the
float value and is approximately *linear* in array index for log-spaced
(geometric) data. That makes the bit-domain linear extrapolation a far
better guess than the float-domain linear extrapolation on geometric data
— sometimes O(1) versus O(log n) refinement cost.

**Opt-in only.** `Auto` does not pick `BitInterpolationSearch`. The bench
sweep at `bench/bitinterp_sweep.jl` covers 1404 cells (9 v patterns × 4 q
patterns × 6 n sizes up to 2²⁰ × 7 m sizes, exercising pure-geometric,
log-spaced over 18 decades, power-of-2 spacing, two-decade clumps, and
jittered-log alongside uniform/sqrt as negative controls). BitInterp
wins outright in 59 cells (4.2%) and sits within 10% of the per-cell
best in 75 cells (5.3%). The wins concentrate in:

  - `logspaced` / `logspaced_wide` / `geometric_dense` / `geometric_sparse`
    / `jittered_log` — i.e. genuinely geometric data.
  - Small `m` (= 4, occasionally 16): the per-query bit-domain guess cost
    amortizes poorly across larger batches.
  - Large `n` (≥ 2¹⁴, peaking at 2²⁰): the saved bracket refinement scales
    with `log₂ n`, while the per-query setup cost is constant.

Sample wins (BitInterp vs second-best, ns/q):

| Cell | BitInterp | Runner-up | Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| `logspaced_wide log_grid n=2²⁰ m=4` | 52.5 | InterpolationSearch 75.0 | 1.43× |
| `logspaced_wide log_grid n=2¹² m=4` | 35.0 | ExpFromLeft 47.5 | 1.36× |
| `logspaced_wide log_grid n=2¹⁸ m=4` | 47.5 | ExpFromLeft 62.5 | 1.32× |
| `logspaced_wide dense_grid n=2²⁰ m=4` | 50.0 | ExpFromLeft 65.0 | 1.30× |

`Auto` doesn't pick it because:
  - The wins are narrow (4% of cells in a bench specifically designed to
    probe BitInterp's regime).
  - Adding the eligibility check to `Auto`'s hot path (Float64 + positive
    + log-linear sampled probe) would burn a few ns on every call, paying
    back only in cells with `m ≤ 16` where Auto's overhead already
    dominates the per-query cost.
  - Users with a known log-spaced workload can pin
    `searchsortedlast!(out, v, queries; strategy = BitInterpolationSearch())`
    once and get the win without any heuristic cost.

The strategy is retained as an opt-in for callers whose workload sits
outside what `Auto` discovers cheaply: domain-specific tables (radiation
transport, log-frequency, gravitational potentials) or hardware where
Float64 division is unusually cheap.

Falls back to plain `InterpolationSearch` on non-Float64 dense eltypes
(where the bit pattern equals the value, making the strategies
equivalent), and to `BinaryBracket` for non-positive or non-finite Float64
data.

### BracketGallop

Galloping search around the hint: expand `[lo, hi]` outward by doubling steps
until `x` is bracketed, then binary-search inside `[lo, hi]`. Direction is
inferred from `v[hint]` vs. `x`, so the hint can be either above or below the
answer. Worst case is ~2 log₂ n — about twice plain binary search — and it
matches O(1) when the hint is close.

This is the workhorse hinted strategy and the natural choice for
`get_idx`-style callers where the hint is a cached previous result.

### ExpFromLeft

Exponential search forward from a hint interpreted as a *lower bound*. The
algorithm probes `v[lo], v[lo+1], …, v[lo+4]` linearly, then `v[lo+8],
v[lo+16], …` exponentially, then binary-searches inside the final bracket.

Used by `Auto`'s batched dispatch when the queries are sorted: each call
passes `hint = previous_result`, which by sortedness satisfies the "answer ≥
hint" precondition. When the precondition is violated (the caller passes a
hint past the answer), `ExpFromLeft` falls back to a full
`searchsortedfirst` / `searchsortedlast` — slow but correct.

### InterpolationSearch

Computes a guess via linear extrapolation between `v[lo]` and `v[hi]`, then
refines with a bounded binary search around that guess. On uniformly-spaced
numeric data the first guess is the right answer — O(1) per query
independent of `n`. On irregular data the guess is bad and the binary search
inside the (full) bracket falls back to O(log n).

Two restrictions:

  - **Numeric eltype**: requires `x - v[i]` to be well-defined and produce a
    number whose ratio with `v[hi] - v[lo]` makes sense. Non-numeric eltypes
    fall back to `BinaryBracket`.
  - **Forward ordering only**: the linear-extrapolation formula assumes
    `v[lo] ≤ v[hi]`. Non-`Forward` orderings fall back to `BinaryBracket`.

The hint is ignored — the guess is computed fresh from the endpoints.

### BinaryBracket

Plain `Base.searchsortedlast` / `Base.searchsortedfirst`. Provided as a
strategy so that callers can opt out of hint-based behaviour explicitly, and
so that other strategies have a well-defined name to fall back to. Ignores
any hint that is supplied.

### Auto

See [Auto: heuristics and benchmarks](@ref) for the full decision tree and
the benchmark sweep that produced its crossover constants.

## Equality routines

The package exposes two `Union{Int, Nothing}`-returning equality routines —
[`findfirstequal`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.findfirstequal) (unsorted SIMD
scan) and [`findfirstsortedequal`](@ref FindFirstFunctions.findfirstsortedequal)
(sorted bisect-then-SIMD scan). They live outside the strategy framework
because their return semantics differ (`nothing` on miss, vs. in-range
index for the positional API). See the [Equality search](@ref Equality-search) page for the
full documentation.
