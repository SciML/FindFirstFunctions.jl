    SearchProperties(v::AbstractVector; linear_tolerance = 1.0e-3, is_uniform = false)

Run the linearity probe and (for floating-point eltypes) the NaN scan on `v`,
returning the populated [`SearchProperties`](@ref). Cost is O(n) on
floating-point vectors because of the NaN scan; for integer and non-numeric
eltypes the cost is O(1) — only the sampled-linearity probe runs.

`linear_tolerance` controls the maximum relative deviation accepted by the
sampled-linearity probe. The default `1e-3` (0.1%) matches `Auto`'s
un-cached probe behaviour. Loosen it (e.g. to `1e-2`) to accept noisier
"approximately linear" data — this widens the regime where `Auto` will pick
`InterpolationSearch` over `ExpFromLeft`. Tighten it (e.g. to `1e-4`) to be
more conservative.

`is_uniform` is a caller-supplied flag for `Vector`s that are exactly
uniformly spaced. Setting it `true` opts the vector into
[`UniformStep`](@ref)'s closed-form O(1) path via `Auto`. There is no
detection probe — uniform spacing on a `Vector` can't be confirmed
cheaply, and an approximate-uniform vector would give wrong answers
under `UniformStep`'s exact-step assumption. For `AbstractRange` inputs
the flag is set automatically by the dedicated overload below.

Specialised constructor for `AbstractRange{<:Real}`. Skips every runtime
probe — every property is known statically from the type:

  - `is_linear = true` — ranges are linear in index by construction.
  - `is_uniform = true` — ranges have exact uniform spacing.
  - `has_nan = false` — `AbstractRange{<:Real}` values are computed from
    `first(r) + (i - 1) * step(r)`; barring `first(r)` or `step(r)`
    themselves being NaN, the values are all finite. For the rare
    pathological `LinRange(NaN, …, …)` case the caller is on their own.
  - `is_log_linear = false` — a range that's linear in index is *not*
    log-linear in value (the values are arithmetically, not
    geometrically, spaced). The flag would only be `true` for ranges of
    `exp(x)` values, which Julia represents as a `Vector`, not an
    `AbstractRange`.
