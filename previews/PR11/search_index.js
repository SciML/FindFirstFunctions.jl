If x is outside that range, either lo will be firstindex(v) or hi will be lastindex(v).\n\nNote that the results will not typically satisfy lo ≤ guess ≤ hi.  If x is precisely equal to a value that is not unique in the input v, there is no guarantee that (lo, hi) will encompass all indices corresponding to that value.\n\nThis algorithm is essentially an expanding binary search, which can be used as a precursor to searchsorted and related functions, which can take lo and hi as arguments.  The purpose of using this function first would be to accelerate convergence in those functions by using correlated guesses for repeated calls.  The best guess for the next call of this function would be the index returned by the previous call to searchsorted.\n\nSee Base.sort! for an explanation of the keyword arguments by, lt and rev.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#FindFirstFunctions.searchsortedfirstcorrelated","page":"FindFirstFunctions.jl","title":"FindFirstFunctions.searchsortedfirstcorrelated","text":"searchsortedfirstcorrelated(v::AbstractVector{T}, x, guess)\n\nAn accelerated findfirst on sorted vectors using a bracketed search.
